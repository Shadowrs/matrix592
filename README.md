# matrix592

Changes to base:
- gradle added
- replaced some but not all usages of 'fastExecutor' with engine-correct calls (ask for info)- specifically Item Switching and Prayers


Client download (38mb)
<br>
IMPORTANT: client HD only works when run with Java 6 JRE. Zipped client comes with JRE6 bundled (~110mb packed) and a windows .bat file to run the client using bundled jre6.
<br>
If run with java7+ the dll's will fail to load (jaclib.dll etc) when HD is selected in the graphics options menu
